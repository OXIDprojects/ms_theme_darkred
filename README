This is an adaption of the color scheme of OXID eShop based on Azure theme.
Just /src/oxid.css and maybe some image files in /src/bg/ will be touched.

Installation:
1) Download, unzip and copy these files to /out/ms_theme_darkred/ of your OXID eShop installation.
2) clear the /tmp/ folder of your OXID eShop installation
3) fire up your browser with your OXID eShop installation, run the admin panel on Extensions --> Themes, mark the DarkRed theme and activate it.
4) If it is not working or brings up error messages, please flush your browser cache (had this issue with Firefox under Ubuntu and spent hours to fix it)

Please note: This theme is still under development, help is welcome.
